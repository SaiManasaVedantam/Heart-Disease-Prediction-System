# Heart Disease Prediction System
The key idea is to find the probability of getting attacked by heart disease based a person's & his/her family's medical history by using machine learning models on the datasets. The prediction result is 90% accurate and not just based on recent medical reports but can use data for the past 5 years so that the person can take necessary care to avoid the trouble which helps us in addressing the issue of lack of reliable systems to detect heart diseases with maximum accuracy.

# Machine Learning Techniques Used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. Support Vector Machine

# Scope:
This project can be applied in the following domains:
1. To appoint employees in risk prone jobs.
2. To choose appropriate treatment in case of an attack.
3. To take necessary actions based on the prediction result.

# Technologies Used:
1. Python
2. Flask
3. Graphlab Create
4. SQL
5. Basic HTML (As the project is more focused on reliable prediction but not on UI)

# Project done in: November 2018
